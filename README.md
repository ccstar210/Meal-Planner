# Meal Planner
A web application created with the MERN stack written in JavaScript where a user can keep track of weekly meal plans, a grocery list, food inventory items, and recipes all in one place for easy access.
## Description
This project consists of four main components: meal plans, grocery list, food inventory, and recipes.

### Home page (meal plans)
A user can create and edit weekly meal plans that start with Sunday and end with Saturday. When the page loads, the current week is displayed if there is a meal plan already created for that week. There is a dropdown option to choose the meal plan week to display. The meal plan entry has a row for each day of the week and a breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks column.

The home page contains a side bar which displays the grocery list and favorited recipes.

### Grocery list page

### Inventory page


### Recipes page

## Dependencies/Technologies Used
### Main Technologies
* MongoDB: v4.4.0
* Express.js: v4.17.1
* React: v16.13.1
* Node.js: v12.18.3

*See package.json and package.json in the client folder for a comprehensive list of dependencies and their versions.*

## Future Work
* Applying machine learning principles to create a recommender system for the grocery list section for suggested items to buy and for the recipe section for suggested recipes to try (based on current recipes, meal plan entries, and current inventory items).
* Using more API's to incorporate more features for meal planning such as food nutrition facts, calorie tracker, and in season foods for the grocery list section.
* Highlight food items in the inventory that are about to expire and move to top.
